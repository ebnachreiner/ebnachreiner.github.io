<h1>Portcullis to the Mythical Website</h1>
<h2>A ruleset for medieval fantasy violence.</h2>

<p>This is a ruleset for medieval roleplaying campaigns of sword and sorcery. <br>Many rules have been filched from the original, Basic, and 5th editions of D&D, and other roleplaying games including (but not limited to) Castles & Crusades, Original Edition Delta, and Dungeon Crawl Classics. <br>These rules are intended for use in campaign settings reminiscent of works by Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, Michael Moorcock, C. L. Moore, and Robert E. Howard. <br>The world is a dangerous place filled with evil sorceries and dark underworlds which contain great treasures and terrible horrors. <br>The players are not expected to know any of the rules to start playing, other than those necessary for character generation. <br>Before play, the referee should prepare an overworld map of the playersâ€™ immediate area (a barony or so) containing hamlets, towns, castles, caves, ruins, and dungeons or dungeon-like environments (e.g., towers, mines, temples, crypts) with maps of their own. <br>The dungeon maps should be stocked with monsters of various horrid aspect, treasures, traps, and mystery.</p>
